  	This package contains the basic Matlab scripts used in the paper: 
	"Rare allele detection using compressed se(que)nsing", by Noam Shental, Amnon Amir and Or Zuk

	Please look at the file pooling_example.m for instructions.

	These scripts use specific files taken from the GPSR package (relevant file included) available from: 
	
	http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/GPSR/

	The package enables simulations of different sequencing pooling experiments, including pooling design, 

	modelling sequencing errors, reconstruction of genotype vectors and evaluating reconstruction accuracy.

	It may serve as guideline for designing pooling sequencing experimenets, including sample size and pooling
	
	design chosen. 

	The package was tested on Matlab 2009b, but should work on most Matlab versions. 	

	Please send any comments/bug reports to: Noam Shental: shental@openu.ac.il
